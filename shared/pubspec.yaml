  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
      - ../assets/fonts/
      - ../assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy
      fonts:
        - asset: ../assets/fonts/gilroy_regular.ttf
          weight: 400

        - asset: ../assets/fonts/gilroy_semibold.ttf
          weight: 600

        - asset: ../assets/fonts/gilroy_black.ttf
          weight: 700

        - asset: ../assets/fonts/gilroy_light.ttf
          weight: 100
